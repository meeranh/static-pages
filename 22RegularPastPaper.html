            <li>Least Privilege</li>
            <li>Separation of Duties</li>
            <li>Defense in Depth</li>
            <li>Fail Safe</li>
            <li>Complete Mediation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You are free to select <strong>four</strong> of these and analyze how they are implemented in modern-day software giants like Google, Facebook, Uber, etc.

        <div class="answer" id="answer1a">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Least Privilege:</strong><br>
                    Modern tech companies like Google implement the principle of least privilege by ensuring that users and services have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. For example, Google's internal systems grant employees access only to the data and systems they need for their roles, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Separation of Duties:</strong><br>
                    Facebook applies separation of duties by dividing responsibilities among different teams and systems. For instance, the team responsible for developing code is separate from the team that deploys code to production. This reduces the risk of fraud and errors, as no single individual has control over all aspects of a critical process.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Defense in Depth:</strong><br>
                    Uber employs a multi-layered security approach to protect its infrastructure and data. This includes perimeter defenses like firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as well as internal controls such as encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring. By having multiple layers, if one security measure fails, others are in place to maintain security.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Fail Safe:</strong><br>
                    Companies like Google design their systems to default to a secure state in the event of a failure. For example, if an authentication service becomes unavailable, systems are designed to deny access rather than allow potentially unauthorized access. This ensures that security is maintained even when unexpected issues occur.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>b. Critique of Least Privilege in Mobile Devices</h3>
        <p>
            The principle of least privilege is the act of providing only the minimum level of access necessary to perform a particular task regarding software design. Examples include runtime privileges, need-to-know, and access controls. Critique how modern-day mobile devices like Android phones or iPhones use these in their implementations.

        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer1b', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1b">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                Modern mobile operating systems like Android and iOS implement the principle of least privilege through several mechanisms:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Runtime Permissions:</strong> Apps request permissions at runtime rather than at installation. Users can grant or deny access to specific features (e.g., location, camera) when the app needs them, ensuring apps have access only when necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Sandboxing:</strong> Each app operates in its own sandboxed environment, isolating it from other apps and system resources. This prevents apps from accessing data or functions they don't need.</li>
                <li><strong>Need-to-Know Access:</strong> Apps are required to declare the permissions they need in their manifest files (Android) or plist files (iOS). The operating system enforces these declared permissions, and apps cannot access resources beyond what they have requested and been granted.</li>
                <li><strong>User Control:</strong> Users have the ability to review and modify app permissions in the device settings, giving them control over what each app can access.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While these measures enhance security by adhering to the principle of least privilege, there are challenges. Some users may grant unnecessary permissions out of convenience or lack of understanding, and malicious apps may exploit granted permissions. Continuous improvements are needed to balance usability and security.

        <h3>d. Assessment of Uber Hack Root Causes (5 marks)</h3>
        <p>
            This is an open-ended question. Even though most of the software secure requirements are analyzed, why was Uber hacked recently? Assess the root causes of this major issue for this kind of incident.
        </p>
        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer1d', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1d">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                The recent Uber hack can be attributed to several root causes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Attackers used social engineering techniques to trick an employee into revealing login credentials or accepting multi-factor authentication (MFA) requests, bypassing security measures.</li>
                <li><strong>Weak MFA Implementation:</strong> The MFA system may have been vulnerable to fatigue attacks, where repeated prompts lead the user to approve access inadvertently.</li>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Access Controls:</strong> Once inside, the attacker gained access to critical systems, indicating that network segmentation and least privilege principles were not adequately enforced.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Monitoring:</strong> The intrusion was not detected promptly, suggesting inadequate monitoring and incident response capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Despite having secure software requirements, human factors and implementation gaps can lead to breaches. Continuous employee training, robust MFA methods (like hardware tokens), strict access controls, and effective monitoring are essential to prevent such incidents.

        <h2>Question 2</h2>

        <h3>a. From Requirements to Secure Software Design</h3>
        <p>
            Once a software developer is clear with the secure software concepts and requirements, the next step is to design a secure software.
        </p>
        <p><strong>i. What is the difference between requirement analysis and secure software design? (3 marks)</strong></p>
        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer2a1', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2a1">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Requirement Analysis:</strong> This phase involves gathering and defining what the software system should do, including functional and non-functional requirements. It focuses on understanding stakeholder needs, identifying system objectives, and documenting specifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Secure Software Design:</strong> This phase translates requirements into a blueprint for building the software, with a focus on security. It involves defining the system architecture, components, interfaces, and data flows, incorporating security controls and best practices to mitigate identified risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key difference is that requirement analysis defines "what" the system should do, while secure software design defines "how" the system will meet those requirements securely.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>ii. Is the design more important than the analysis and requirement gathering? Justify your answer. (4 marks)</strong></p>
        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer2a2', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2a2">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                Both phases are critically important and interdependent. However, one could argue that without thorough requirement analysis, the design may not address the actual needs or may overlook critical security requirements. Conversely, even with excellent requirements, a poor design can introduce vulnerabilities and fail to meet security objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, neither phase is more important than the other; both are essential. A successful project requires accurate requirement analysis followed by a secure and effective design to implement those requirements.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>iii. As the design talks about a solution and a solution involves technology, justify whether securing technologies would solve the problem. (3 marks)</strong></p>
        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer2a3', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2a3">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                Securing technologies are tools that can help implement security controls, but they alone do not solve the problem. Security is a holistic process that includes people, processes, and technology. Without proper implementation, policies, training, and maintenance, even the most advanced technologies can be ineffective.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, while securing technologies are essential components of a solution, they must be integrated into a comprehensive security strategy that includes secure design principles, risk management, and ongoing assessment to effectively solve security problems.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>b. Synopsis of Security Architecture Components (5 marks)</h3>
        <p>
            Security Architecture is a vital component of any software design. This is used by any big software vendor. Read the below extract about security architecture:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Security architecture includes 'control identification and prioritization.' Various other components of security architecture include distributed computing (e.g., message queuing, peer-to-peer, and client-server), service-oriented architecture (e.g., web services, service bus, and enterprise), rich internet applications (e.g., constant connectivity, remote code execution, client-side exploits), pervasive/ubiquitous computing (e.g., sensor networks, near field communication, RFID, location-based, wireless, and IoT), embedded (e.g., firmware, control systems), cloud architectures (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service), hardware platform concerns, mobile applications."
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Build your synopsis about the above showcasing the practical usage.</strong></p>
        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer2b', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer2b">

        <h3>d. Zero-Trust Security Model and Google's Implementation (10 marks)</h3>
        <p><strong>i. Explain the Zero Trust security implementation. (4 marks)</strong></p>
        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer3d1', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer3d1">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                The Zero Trust security model is a framework that operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that threats can originate from inside or outside the network, and thus, no user or device is automatically trusted. Key components include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Continuous Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Verifying user identity and device health each time access is requested.</li>
                <li><strong>Least Privilege Access:</strong> Providing users with the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Micro-Segmentation:</strong> Dividing networks into small zones to maintain separate access for different parts of the network.</li>
                <li><strong>Visibility and Analytics:</strong> Monitoring user activity and network traffic to detect anomalies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Zero Trust enhances security by reducing the attack surface and limiting lateral movement within the network.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="answer" id="answer3d2">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                Google implemented the Zero Trust model through its BeyondCorp initiative, which shifts access controls from the network perimeter to individual devices and users. Key aspects include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device and User Authentication:</strong> Every access request is authenticated and authorized based on the user's identity and the device's security posture.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control Policies:</strong> Policies are enforced at the application level, granting access based on contextual factors such as user role, device compliance, and location.</li>
                <li><strong>Encrypted Communication:</strong> All communication between devices and services is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and data breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Google's systems continuously monitor for suspicious activity and enforce security policies in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Changes:</strong> Google redesigned its network architecture to support Zero Trust, removing implicit trust based on network location (e.g., being inside the corporate firewall).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By adopting Zero Trust, Google improved its security posture, especially in a cloud-centric and mobile workforce environment. It reduced reliance on VPNs and perimeter defenses, embracing a more flexible and secure access model.

        <h3>c. Lessons Learned from TikTok Vulnerability Incident (5 marks)</h3>
        <p>
            Read the following extract of a TikTok vulnerability discovered by Microsoft:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Microsoft discovered a high-severity vulnerability in the TikTok Android application, which could have allowed attackers to compromise users' accounts with a single click. The vulnerability, which would have required several issues to be chained together to exploit, has been fixed, and we did not locate any evidence of in-the-wild exploitation. Attackers could have leveraged the vulnerability to hijack an account without users' awareness if a targeted user simply clicked a specially crafted link. Attackers could have then accessed and modified users' TikTok profiles and sensitive information, such as by publicizing private videos, sending messages, and uploading videos on behalf of users.

            The vulnerability allowed the app's deeplink verification to be bypassed. Attackers could force the app to load an arbitrary URL to the app's WebView, allowing the URL to then access the WebView's attached JavaScript bridges and grant functionality to attackers. We've previously researched JavaScript bridges for their potential wide-reaching implications. Emphasizing the importance of exercising caution when clicking unknown links, this research also displays how collaboration within the security community is necessary to improve defenses for the overall digital ecosystem."

                **Scenario and Lessons Learned:**
            </p>
            <p>
                During the assignment, I identified a vulnerability where user input was directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to a potential SQL injection attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                **Lesson Learned:**
            </p>
            <p>
                This highlighted the critical importance of input validation and the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements. By implementing these practices, we can prevent attackers from manipulating queries and accessing or altering unauthorized data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, this scenario emphasized the need for secure coding practices to be ingrained in the development process, along with regular code reviews to catch such vulnerabilities early.
