    <h2 id="question-2">Question 2</h2>
    <p>Your Security Team Should Be Able to Answer,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who can access data?</li>
        <li>Where does sensitive data live?</li>
        <li>How do you protect data?</li>
        <li>How do you verify that controls and policies are working?</li>
        <li>Do you have an audit trail of activity?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Above are the common type of questions which can come across a system administrator's mind. Now answer the following questions as a security consultant:</p>
    <p><strong>a).</strong> How do you find the value of Software Threat Modelling to create better secure software?</p>
    <p><strong>b).</strong> You are being asked audit questions of what are the major controls which you can use for maintaining the availability of the organization. What is the purpose of an audit in secure software development? Explain the challenges in auditing software?</p>
    <p><strong>c).</strong> Define what is availability, the perspective of the user, custodian, and the owner. Which availability type of the given stakeholder can be critical?</p>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>a).</strong> Software Threat Modeling is valuable because it helps identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities early in the development process. This proactive approach allows developers to design and implement security measures to mitigate risks, resulting in more secure software.</p>
        <p><strong>b).</strong> The purpose of an audit in secure software development is to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls and ensure compliance with policies and regulations. Challenges include the complexity of software systems, keeping up with rapid changes, and the difficulty in thoroughly examining all components within limited time frames.</p>
        <p><strong>c).</strong> Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed. From a user's perspective, it's about accessing services without interruption. For custodians, it involves maintaining system uptime. For owners, it relates to business continuity. The owner's perspective can be most critical as it affects the organization's overall operations.</p>

    <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>a).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>i).</strong> Software Kernels in web development refer to the core components that manage system resources. Understanding kernel operations can enhance security by managing permissions and memory, although direct interaction is limited in web development.</p>
        <p><strong>ii).</strong> Software Reference Monitors enforce access control policies. In web development, they ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources or perform specific actions.</p>
        <p><strong>iii).</strong> API workflows involve designing APIs with secure authentication, authorization, and input validation to protect data exchange between services.</p>
        <p><strong>b).</strong> Data retention techniques include backups, snapshots, and archival. Challenges involve managing rapidly changing data, ensuring data integrity, and complying with legal requirements. Techniques must be scalable and secure to handle continuous updates.</p>
        <p><strong>c).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>i).</strong> Implementing access controls so that users only access data they need.</p>
        <p><strong>ii).</strong> Ensuring secure communication channels, encryption, and authentication mechanisms.</p>
        <p><strong>iii.</strong> Regularly testing and patching APIs to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>d).</strong> Separation of duty prevents conflict of interest by dividing tasks among multiple people. For example, developers shouldn't deploy code to production. Similar techniques include least privilege and mandatory vacations.</p>

    <h2 id="question-4">Question 4</h2>
    <p><strong>a.</strong> Testing is one of the key issues for defensive secure code and programming. Explain how testing and auditing can be different once used in secure software development.</p>
    <p><strong>b.</strong> Testing can be done for misuse and abuse cases,</p>
    <pre><code>i. Explain how this concept can be viable, once deciding on secure code architecture.
    
ii. Provide examples for misuse and abuse cases that are relevant to modern software development.
</code></pre>
    <p><strong>c.</strong> What is a sandbox? Provide a few examples of how sandbox can be used to model secure development. What are the challenges of these applications.</p>
    <p><strong>d.</strong> For IoT and mobile security, testing needs capacity testing due to the performance hits due to limited footprint. Hence explain how Network, CPU, memory, and DB lockdowns need to test for capacity.</p>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>a.</strong> Testing focuses on identifying defects and vulnerabilities through execution of code, while auditing reviews code and processes for compliance with security standards. Testing is dynamic; auditing is static.</p>
        <p><strong>b.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>i.</strong> Considering misuse and abuse cases helps in designing architecture that can withstand malicious activities by anticipating potential attacks.</p>
        <p><strong>ii.</strong> Examples include SQL injection attacks (abuse) or users entering unexpected data formats (misuse).</p>
        <p><strong>c.</strong> A sandbox is an isolated environment for running code securely. Examples include browser sandboxes and virtual machines. Challenges include performance overhead and ensuring complete isolation.</p>
        <p><strong>d.</strong> Testing should simulate resource constraints to ensure the application performs adequately. Network throttling, CPU and memory limits, and database stress tests help identify potential bottlenecks.</p>

    <h2 id="question-5">Question 5</h2>
    <p>There is a wide variety of information security and information technology frameworks that provide guidance to appropriate controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and services (some you might have heard of include NIST SP800-53, NIST Cyber Security Framework, ISO 27001, HITRUST, COBIT, ITIL, CIS Controls, and AICPA Trust Services Criteria). Choosing the correct one depends on your compliance obligations, geography, business vertical, and organizational complexity.</p>
    <p><strong>a.</strong> Do a thorough analysis of the above which can be suitable for a Defensive Secure Coding project.</p>
    <p><strong>b.</strong> How important is it to use secure controls in development?</p>
    <p><strong>c.</strong> How do you think a framework like STRIDE can be of use for a Web 3.0 (Blockchain) Development activity?</p>

    <p><strong>e.</strong> Are we able to measure and demonstrate compliance with global data privacy regulations?</p>
    <button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
    <div class="answer">
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>a.</strong> For a Defensive Secure Coding project, frameworks like NIST SP800-53 and ISO 27001 are suitable as they provide comprehensive controls for software security.</p>
        <p><strong>b.</strong> Using secure controls is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities, ensure compliance, and protect data integrity and confidentiality.</p>
        <p><strong>c.</strong> STRIDE can help identify potential threats in blockchain applications by categorizing them into Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, and Elevation of privilege.</p>
        <p><strong>d.</strong> ISO 27034 may lack specificity for certain technologies and can be resource-intensive. It's important to tailor testing methods to the project's needs.</p>
        <p><strong>e.</strong> Yes, through regular audits, assessments, and by implementing compliance frameworks, we can measure and demonstrate adherence to data privacy regulations.</p>
