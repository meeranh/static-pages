        <h3>c. Choosing Between "Fail-Soft" and "Fail-Hard" in a Nuclear Power Plant Control System (5 marks)</h3>
        <p>
            Consider a real-world scenario in which a nuclear power plant's control system is being designed. The control system is responsible for regulating critical processes and ensuring the safe operation of the plant. In this high-stakes environment, fault tolerance is of utmost importance to prevent catastrophic failures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The control system has encountered a situation where a sensor reading indicates a potential anomaly. The system needs to decide how to respond to this anomaly. Two fault tolerance methods are under consideration: "Fail-Soft" and "Fail-Hard."
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the critical nature of a nuclear power plant control system, which fault tolerance method—Fail-Soft or Fail-Hard—do you believe would be more suitable in this scenario? Provide a detailed explanation of your choice, considering factors such as safety, potential consequences of system errors, and the overall reliability of the control system.
        </p>
        <button onclick="showAnswer('answer1c', this)">Show ChatGPT Answer</button>
        <div class="answer" id="answer1c">
            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p>
                **Fail-Hard** (also known as **Fail-Safe**) would be more suitable for a nuclear power plant control system.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Safety First:</strong> In a nuclear power plant, safety is the highest priority. Any anomaly could lead to catastrophic consequences, such as radiation leaks or meltdowns. A Fail-Hard approach ensures the system transitions to a safe state immediately upon detecting an anomaly.</li>
                <li><strong>Immediate Response:</strong> Fail-Hard methods stop operations or shut down systems to prevent further risk. This immediate action reduces the chance of an accident escalating due to continued operation under faulty conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventing Catastrophic Failures:</strong> By defaulting to a safe state, the system minimizes the risk of severe outcomes resulting from system errors or failures.</li>
                <li><strong>Reliability and Predictability:</strong> Fail-Hard provides a predictable response to anomalies, which is crucial in high-stakes environments where uncertainty can lead to disaster.</li>
                <li><strong>Fail-Soft Risks:</strong> Fail-Soft allows systems to continue operating in a degraded mode. In a nuclear plant, operating under degraded conditions can be dangerous, as it might mask underlying issues or delay necessary interventions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Therefore, adopting a Fail-Hard approach aligns with the critical safety requirements of a nuclear power plant by ensuring that any detected anomalies lead to immediate, safe shutdown procedures.

            <p>
                This scenario violates the fundamental design principle of <strong>Complete Mediation</strong>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Justification:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Complete Mediation Principle:</strong> Every access to a resource must be checked for authorization. No access should be granted without proper validation and authorization checks.</li>

            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p><strong>Asset-Centric Threat Profile:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Centers on protecting the organization's valuable assets, such as data, systems, and infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Priorities:</strong> Identifies critical assets, assesses their vulnerabilities, and implements controls to safeguard them. Emphasis is on asset value and the potential impact of their compromise.</li>
                <li><strong>Implications:</strong> May overlook emerging threats if they don't directly target identified assets. Can lead to a defensive posture that is reactive rather than proactive against evolving attacker tactics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Attacker-Centric Threat Profile:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Concentrates on understanding potential attackers, their motivations, capabilities, and methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Priorities:</strong> Profiles different threat actors (e.g., cybercriminals, nation-states, insiders) and anticipates their likely attack vectors. Emphasis is on threat intelligence and predicting attacker behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Implications:</strong> Allows for proactive defense by anticipating attacks, but may allocate resources to threats that don't impact critical assets. Can be resource-intensive to maintain up-to-date threat intelligence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Both approaches have merits and limitations. An asset-centric profile ensures that critical assets are protected but may miss threats that target less obvious vulnerabilities. An attacker-centric profile provides a broader view of potential threats but may dilute focus on protecting key assets. A balanced approach that integrates both perspectives can offer comprehensive security by protecting valuable assets while staying informed about evolving threats.

            <h4>Answer:</h4>
            <p><strong>Concept of Sensitive Data Exposure:</strong></p>
            <p>
                Sensitive data exposure occurs when applications do not adequately protect confidential or personal information, leading to unauthorized access or disclosure. This can include data such as passwords, credit card numbers, personal identification information, or proprietary business data.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Primary Reasons for Sensitive Data Exposure:</strong></p>

                Each method has its strengths and weaknesses. SAST is effective for early detection of code issues, DAST simulates real-world attacks on running applications, and IAST provides in-depth analysis by monitoring applications during execution. A combination of these methods is often employed to achieve comprehensive security testing, ensuring vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated throughout the software development lifecycle.
