	<h2>How To Use</h2>
	The <b>short title</b> and <b>section number</b> are directly from the act PDFs. You can read these one by one, try to
	understand what each act means, and try to remember which short title relates to which concept, so in the exam, you
	can CTRL+F the short title and refer to that. Not all sections are covered in this; only the ones that are important
	were included.</p>
